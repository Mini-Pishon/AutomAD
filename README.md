# Injection

## AD_addusers.ps1

This PowerShell script automates the creation of Organizational Units (OUs) and users in Active Directory (AD) based on data from a CSV file. The script performs the following actions:

### 1. Prerequisites

- Ensure the Active Directory module is available on the system where the script is executed.
- Prepare a CSV file (users.csv) with user data, including columns for first_name, last_name, and password.

### 2. Script Overview

####  1. Input

- CSV File: The script reads user data from C:\scripts\Ad_scripts\users.csv. Ensure the file is in the correct format and accessible.

####  2. Actions Performed

- Import CSV Data:
    - Reads user data from the specified CSV file.

#### 3. Import Active Directory Module:

- Imports the Active Directory module to manage AD operations.

#### 4. Define Base OU Path:

Sets the base path for OUs as DC=dinoland,DC=lan.

#### 5. Create Organizational Units (OUs):

- Creates the main OU "CORE" under the base path.
- Creates the "HUMANS" OU under "CORE".
- Creates "USERS" and "ADMIN" OUs under "HUMANS".

#### 6. Process CSV Data to Create Users:

- Iterates through the CSV data to create users in AD.
- Determines the target OU based on the user index (first 200 users go to "USERS", others to "ADMIN").
- Checks for missing first name or last name and skips such entries.
- Creates users with the specified attributes (name, email, password) if they do not already exist in AD.

### Error Handling

The script includes error handling for OU and user creation, with warnings and a pause of 5 seconds for errors.
Output
The script outputs the status of OU and user creation to the console, indicating success or any errors encountered.
Usage
Place the users.csv file in the specified directory (C:\scripts\Ad_scripts\).
Ensure the script has the necessary permissions to create OUs and users in Active Directory.
Execute the script in a PowerShell environment with the Active Directory module available.
